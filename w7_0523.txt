-------------------POST/GET----------------------------
one request => one response

app.use(express.static...)
=========
"base route" :
tell the server when the home/ request comes
check inside 'server/public' file => it will check if there is the index.html, if exists send it back

browser will display index.html and go through the file
when it comes to the script lines or link line => recognized as static file 
    => go to check server/public again (defined at app.use(express.static)) the js or css files sourced in
    => if not, keep going; if there, source in the files

order could matter => first come first serve

============
$.ajax make a get request on the /quotes
=> go to server.js
=> get response from the route
=> send response back to client.js
=> client.js responsible to get the content to the DOM

client side wont have access to the server directly
using ajax to access the data on server
/quotes is the place as intermediary to pass the array from server to client side
