jQuery review:
with document.ready 
=> jQuery will load after the entire html page is loaded
=> document will only be ready when the entire html file has gone through (reason why js file could be put at the end)

function onReady() {
    $('#deleteButton').on('click', handleClick()) 
}

function handleClick() {
    console.log('hello events');
}

=> the () after function name - invoke the function immediately
=> return undefined and log the sentence once
=> click event not working (execute 'undefined');

event listener:
-> selector
-> action

this: the context in which we are executing the code => the item just selected
    or the specific thing that trigger the event
