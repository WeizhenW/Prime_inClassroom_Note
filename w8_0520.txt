-----Weekend Challenge Live Code - Mary ---------
//Command Line and Git
rm -rf .git
=> break the link between the local directory vs. the git repo
=> -rf means remove everything inside the folder even including the hidden files
git remote set-url <new github url>

ls -a
=>show everything including hidden files

.gitignore files
=> add files into the file and those files won't be pushed to github

difference b/w:
- .empty(); remove all the child elements 
- .remove(); remove the element itself
- .text(''); only apply when there's no node inside
